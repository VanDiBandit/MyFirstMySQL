What Is a Database?
-A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data,
typically stored electronically in a computer system.
-Data in the databases is created in rows and columns in a series of tables
making it easy to process and query
-Almost all databases are structure query language(SQL) for writing and querying data.


What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?
-SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query,
manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control.
-

Whatâ€™s the difference between a database and a spreadsheet?
-The primary differences between the two are:

 How the data is stored and manipulated
 Who can access the data
 How much data can be stored

-Spreadsheets were designed for 1 user, good for a single user
or small number of users that don't need to do incredibly complicated data manipulation
-Databases were made to hold larger collections of organized information
-Databases also allow multiple users at the same time to quickly and securely access and query
data using complex logic and language

Types of databases
-Relational Databases -Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive,
straightforward way of representing data in tables.
In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key

-Object-oriented databases - is represented in the form of objects, as in object-oriented programming.

-Distributed Databases- A distributed database consists of two or more files located in different sites.
The database may be stored on multiple computers, located in the same physical location, or scattered over
different networks.

-Data warehouses - Central repository, type of database may be stored on multiple computers, located in same physical
location or scattered over different networks

-Data warehouses - A central repository for data, a data warehouse is a type of database specifically designed for fast query and analysis.

-NoSQL databases - or nonrelational database, allows unstructured and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated
(in contrast to a relational database, which defines how all data inserted into the database must be composed).

-Graph Databases - A graph database stores data in terms of entities and the relationships between entities.

-OLTP databases -  An OLTP database is a speedy, analytic database designed for large numbers of
transactions performed by multiple users.

Latest databases:
Open source databases
An open source database system is one whose source code is open source;
such databases could be SQL or NoSQL databases.

Cloud databases
A cloud database is a collection of data, either structured or unstructured,
that resides on a private, public, or hybrid cloud computing platform.
There are two types of cloud database models: traditional and database as a service (DBaaS).
With DBaaS, administrative tasks and maintenance are performed by a service provider.

Multimodel database
Multimodel databases combine different types of database models into a single, integrated back end.
This means they can accommodate various data types.

Document/JSON database
Designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented information, document databases are a
modern way to store data in JSON format rather than rows and columns.

What is database software?
-Database software is used to create, edit, and maintain database files and records, enabling easier file
and record creation, data entry, data editing, updating, and reporting. The software also handles data
storage, backup and reporting, multi-access control, and security

What is a database management system (DBMS)?
-A DBMS serves as an interface between the database and its end users or programs, allowing users to retrieve,
update, and manage how the information is organized and optimized. A DBMS also facilitates oversight and control
of databases, enabling a variety of administrative operations such as performance monitoring, tuning, and backup and recovery.

What is a MySQL database?
-MySQL is an open source relational database management system based on SQL. It was designed and optimized for web applications
and can run on any platform.

Database challenges
-absorbing significant increases in data volume
-Ensuring data security
-Keeping up with demand
-Managing and maintaining the database infrastructure
-Removing limits on scalability
-Ensuring data residency, data soveriegnty, latency requirements
